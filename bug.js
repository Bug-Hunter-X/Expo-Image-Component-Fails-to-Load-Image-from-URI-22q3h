This error occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that is not properly formatted or accessible.  The image may be missing, the URI may contain typos, or there might be network connectivity issues preventing the image from loading.  This can also happen if the image source is dynamic and hasn't been properly set before the component renders.  The exact error message may vary depending on the underlying cause.  For example, Expo might log a warning or error related to the image not loading or a network request failure.
