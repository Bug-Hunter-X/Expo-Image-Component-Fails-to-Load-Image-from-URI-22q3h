# Expo Image Component Image Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo `Image` component: the failure to load an image from a given URI.  The problem is multifaceted, potentially stemming from incorrect or inaccessible URIs, network issues, or race conditions during dynamic image loading.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic implementation. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with explanations.

## Solutions

* **Verify URI:** Double-check the URI for typos and ensure the image exists at the specified location. Consider using a placeholder image while the actual image loads.
* **Network Connectivity:** Confirm a stable network connection.  Test with both local and remote image sources.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage cases where image loading fails.  Consider providing feedback to the user, such as displaying a placeholder or error message.
* **Asynchronous Loading:**  If the image URI is determined asynchronously, make sure the `Image` component is updated *after* the URI is available. Use state and asynchronous functions to handle this correctly.
